# php-app-tracker 

This project hasnt yet been completed so some things may not work. But overall most of the features I have wanted to implement are done.

Not really designed for public use but if you do wish to use it then you must first run the config.php file. Make sure to edit any infomation within the file dor your liking.

Default username and password for an unmodified config.php;

USERNAME = admin

PASSWORD = pass
